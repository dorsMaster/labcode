.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
A server host is capable of running one or more programs where it shares its resources with different clients. Client asks for service from server.
.Lp
Clients send T<n> which are transactions to the server. Server then executes those transactions. The server receives these transactions, processes them and then the server will wait for another client to connect and send a transaction. If no new transactions have been sent in 30 seconds, then the server will close.
Clients should use the same port number as the server. Server will be listening on that port for any communication. The port number has to be between 5000 and 64000.

.It T<n>
T means transaction and the n can be an integer greater than 0. Server will call the command Trans(int n) to execute this command that is received from the client. Upon completion, it notifies the client.
