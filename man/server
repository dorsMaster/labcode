A server host runs one or more server programs, which share
their resources with clients. A client does not share any of its resources, but it
requests content or service from a server. Clients therefore initiate communication
sessions with servers, which await incoming requests. Examples of computer
applications that use the clientâ€“server model are Email, network printing, and
the World Wide Web.
.Lp
Clients generate transactions (T<n>) that get sent to the server to execute. Clients may have lulls between
transactions, so they wait (S<n>) for a transaction to happen. The server receives the
transactions, processes them, and then waits for the next transaction.
.Lp
Port number that the server will read from has to be in the range 5000 to
64,000, the same number that the server uses.
.Lp
The server process reads its input from the port number specified on its command line invocation. Specifically, these messages from clients are transaction requests:
.Lp
T<n>
Execute a transaction with integer parameter n, with n > 0. You will have a routine that gets called for each transaction: void Trans(int n). The parameter n is used by Trans to determine how long to simulate the execution of the transaction.
