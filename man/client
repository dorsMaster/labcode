A server host runs one or more server programs, which share
their resources with clients. Clients therefore initiate communication
sessions with servers, which await incoming requests. Examples of computer
applications that use the clientâ€“server model are Email, network printing, and
the World Wide Web.
.Lp
Clients generate transactions (T<n>) that get sent to the server to execute. Clients may have lulls between
transactions, so they wait (S<n>) for a transaction to happen. The server receives the
transactions, processes them, and then waits for the next transaction.
.Lp
Port number that the server will read from has to be in the range 5000 to 64,000, the same number that the server uses.
.Lp
More specifically, a client process receives input (either from the keyboard or redirected from a file) containing two commands:
.Lp
.IP T<n>
Transaction. The parameter is an integer > 0. This command will be sent to the server for processing. The client sits idle waiting for the server to complete the transaction
.Lp
.IP S<n>
Sleep. This command simulates having the client wait between receiving new transactions to process. The client waits for a time determined by integer parameter n, with n between 0 and 100. You will have a routine that gets called for each sleep request: void Sleep(int n).
