.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm client
.Ar port_number
.Ar ip_address
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Clients start sessions of communication with servers. A server shares their resources with clients and waits for requests from Client. Email is an application that uses the client-server model.
.Lp
Client checks to see whether the port number that the user is asked for is in the range 5000 to 64000. This is as a result of the server only listening on those ports. The port provided to the client should match the port number that the server will listen. The ip address provided should be the ip of the server.
Client process can receive two possible commands. These commands can either be from the keyboard or from an input file.
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It T<n>
T means transaction and the n can be an integer greater than 0. If client reads this command, it will send this along with its hostname to the server to be process. Client will wait for the server to respond that this transaction has successfully been completed.
.Lp
.It S<n>
S means sleep and the n can be an integer between greater than 0 and less than 100. This command is done by the client. This is to simulate that the client has to wait before receiving new commands. Void(sleep int n) is called when the client receives this command.
