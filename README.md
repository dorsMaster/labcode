Client–server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or
workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and
service requesters, called clients. Often clients and servers communicate over
a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in
the same system. A server host runs one or more server programs, which share
their resources with clients. A client does not share any of its resources, but it
requests content or service from a server. Clients therefore initiate communication
sessions with servers, which await incoming requests. Examples of computer
applications that use the client–server model are Email, network printing, and
the World Wide Web.

You are to implement a client-server architecture. The clients receive transactions that they
pass on to the server. Think of a client as a web page where a user initiates a transaction (such
as purchasing an airline ticket). The request gets sent to a server (the airline company) for
processing. This is shown in the following diagram.
